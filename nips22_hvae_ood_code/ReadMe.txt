This code is the implemention for the paper "Out-of-Distribution Detection with An Adaptive
Likelihood Ratio on Informative Hierarchical VAE". 


For running, just run "python scripts/dvae_run_cifar.py" and "python scripts/dvae_run_fmnist.py". 


The code would be public after the paper is accepted.
Most of the code is based on the https://github.com/JakobHavtorn/hvae-oodd.
